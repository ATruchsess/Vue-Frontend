This is a work-in-progress version. Some features, such as Cypress integration, comments, and refactoring, are not fully complete. However, the overall concept and code structure are finalized and will remain unchanged. These areas are simply not as polished as the backend at this stage.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js: Download and install Node.js
    npm (comes with Node.js)
    Visual Studio Code (optional)


Setup and Installation
1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```

```
